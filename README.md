# PlantCLEF2018 200 Flower Models
### Repo of CNN models based on EfficientNet Architectures Family
### Models trained on a subset of flowering plant species of PlantCLEF2018 dataset

We share the pre-trained EfficientNet models as research support in a subset of PlantCLEF2018 dataset. We created a subset of 200 classes, focusing on the most frequent flowering plant species on the dataset. 

We believe that this models may be a good starting point for future research in flower identification. 

The EfficientNet Models were trained using transfer learning from pre-trained models on ImageNet 2012.

### How to consume the pre-trained EfficientNet models (from PlantCLEF 2018 200 Flower dataset)

We used Keras version 2.6, with Tensorflow 2.6 as backend, Python version 3.9, along with CUDA Toolkit version 11.0. 

The EfficientNet models reports the percentage of correct responses within the _Top-K_ highest-ranked predictions generated by the models.

You can evaluate a sample image by performing the following:

```python
python predict.py MODEL_NAME MODEL_PATH IMAGE_TEST_FILE TOP-K
```
Ensure that the .BIN file (class list) is in the same directory as the model so that it can be loaded into the script.

Example _Top-5_:
```python
python predict.py efficientNetB0 /efficientNetB0PC/efficientNetB0PC /images/test/16730-Flower/197417.jpg -TopK 5

Predictions:
16730-Flower,	0.20647123456001282
44075-Flower,	0.1315551996231079
15859-Flower,	0.11214502155780792
152966-Flower,	0.07080081105232239
